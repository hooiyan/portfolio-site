  "example": "I’m a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I’m based in London, UK, but I’m happy working remotely and have experience in remote teams. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. I love being out in nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or cycling. I’d love you to check out my work.",
  "long": "I'm a Front-End Dev and a kidney warrior who had a transplant in 2018. Originally, I was going to get my BS degree in Information System Engineering by then. However, in 2016, I was diagnosed with kidney disease and had to take a break from my studies. Fast forward to 2022, I have taken a different route that would still allow me to enter the tech industry. I build accessible websites and functional web apps. I want to learn more and build more; while I mostly use React-related technologies, I can adapt to whatever tools are required.  I'd love you to check out my work.",
